# TheDOMBasedGame
1. Create two pages, one for login, the other for the game; two html, two css

2. learn a lot about DOM and CSS

3. still improve: how to grap the "click" number as variable; how to grap the login page's name and age as variables to write JS code to set up age limit and apply input-name of login as variable for the game page.
